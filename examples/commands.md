## Troubleshooting Commands

If a command doesn't work, try:

1. **Be more specific**: "Change color" → "Change button background color"
2. **Use exact names**: "header" → "Main Header"
3. **Specify units**: "100" → "100 pixels"
4. **Break into steps**: Instead of "create a styled button", try:
   - "Create a button 150 by 50"
   - "Make it blue"
   - "Add rounded corners"

## Pro Tips

- **Select first**: Select an element in Figma before using "it" or "this"
- **Name consistently**: Use clear, consistent names for elements
- **Test incrementally**: Start with simple commands, then add complexity
- **Use history**: Check the command history to see what worked
- **Combine text and voice**: Type complex commands, speak simple ones
