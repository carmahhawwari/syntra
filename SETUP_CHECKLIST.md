WebSocket: ws://localhost:8080

Next steps:
[instructions...]
===========================================
```

### When Commands Execute:

```
Received message: voice-command
Processing text command: Create a blue rectangle
Gemini response: { command: {...}, confidence: 0.95 }
```

## ‚úÖ Common Issues Resolution

### "Failed to fetch Figma file"
- [ ] Verify `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` is correct
- [ ] Verify `FIGMA_FILE_KEY` is correct
- [ ] Check token has `file_content:read` scope
- [ ] Confirm file exists and you have access

### "Failed to process voice command"
- [ ] Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correct
- [ ] Check Gemini API quota/billing
- [ ] Try text command instead to isolate issue

### "Plugin won't connect"
- [ ] Server is running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Port 8080 is not blocked
- [ ] Using Figma Desktop (not web)
- [ ] Try restarting both server and plugin

### "No nodes found matching"
- [ ] Element name is correct
- [ ] Element exists in current page
- [ ] Try being more specific with name
- [ ] Check Figma layer panel for actual names

## ‚úÖ Development Environment

### For Development Work

- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
  ```bash
  npx tsc --noEmit
  ```

- [ ] Watch mode works
  ```bash
  npm run plugin:watch  # In one terminal
  npm run dev           # In another
  ```

- [ ] Hot reload works
  - Change server code ‚Üí auto-restarts
  - Change plugin code ‚Üí rebuild + reload in Figma
